# Mars Mission Registration Form - Part 1

You are creating a form for people to register to be astronauts on a mission to Mars. You'll have to collect a lot of information, as a mission to Mars can be grueling, uncomfortable, and long.

Therefore, it's important to ask a number of questions! However, today, we're going to ask some pretty basic ones. Note that **as we learn more about building forms, we'll add more inputs to our form** - so build this with a plan to expand!

Our form is going to consist of single component, called `form.js`. You might have noticed that, so far, our interactive items that we've kept track of in state have had (at least) three elements:

- Their part(s) of state.
- Their function that handles receiving user inputs and updating the state.
- Their JSX element(s) that allow the user to interact/input information.

Our app will be no different! It's your task to create parts of state, handler functions, and JSX input elements for all of our questions.

## Step 1: Create a Form

_Note: You are welcome to develop this in Codesandbox, but please submit a React project built on your GitHub! In other words, it has to have a local version, too._

Create a component called `form.js` and import it into your `index.js` file. Place it into your `ReactDOM.render` function and have it
render something small, like an `h1` tag that says "Mission to Mars Registration Form."

Once that's working, add a `div` tag. This `div` will contain our form.

## Step 2: Create Inputs

Inside that `div` tag, we're going to be rendering several `input` and `select` tags, including:

- What is your name? (`text`).
- What is your date of birth?
  - You have two options here:
    - Three `select`s, for month, day, and year (starting at 1900 to the present) - how are you going to store this result in state?).
    - The [date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date) input.
- What is your country of origin? (one `select` - utilize this [JSON list of countries](https://gist.github.com/keeguon/2310008) to generate the options).
- What is your dietary preference? (one `select`, with three options: `omnivore`, `vegetarian`, and `vegan`).
- Why do you want to be a Mars explorer? (`text` - Use CSS to make this input larger, to imply a more lengthy response!).

Finally, create a button that says "submit." This button should update a part of state that demonstrates that the user has completed the form - something along the lines of `formCompleted`.

## Step 3: Verify Inputs

Now that your form has several questions, we'd like to check to see if the user means to submit their form information.

Create several elements that are hidden by default, but shown when `formCompleted` becomes `true`. Don't do this with CSS - do it in the logic of your `render` function. These elements should be:

- A list of the user's responses in `p` tags.
- Another `p` tag that asks the user if they're sure the information is correct.
- A button to submit, with the text "Confirm."

This button should control another part of state - let's call it `formSubmitted`. If `formSubmitted` is `true`, then **all** content is removed from the page except for a single `p` tag with the text: "Thank you for your application."

## Step 4: Styling!

Using a Mars theme (red and orange), and inspired by the [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+forms&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS748US752&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjk2ePhxdrfAhWxUt8KHRU0ArYQ_AUIDygC&biw=1379&bih=759) design language, style this page to your liking.

This [resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Styling_HTML_forms) from MDN will be SUPER useful if you'd like to style any input elements.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
